Certainly! Here is a summary for the `job` and `job status` endpoints to guide the third-party on how to create, update, and check the status of jobs. This will cover the `POST`, `PUT`, and `GET` operations and include details on the API key usage.

### Summary: Interacting with the Job and Job Status Endpoints

This document provides details on how to interact with the job-related endpoints, including creating a new job, updating its status, and retrieving the current status. These endpoints require the use of an API key for authentication.

### 1. **Creating a New Job**

- **Endpoint**: `POST /integrations/direct/job`
- **Headers**: Include the API key in the request header:
  ```
  Authorization: ******
  ```
- **Body**: Send a JSON payload containing job details.
  - **Required Fields**:
    - `id`: A unique identifier for the job.
    - `status`: The initial status of the job (e.g., `"pending"`).
  - **Optional Fields**:
    - `partnerJobID`: A reference ID for the job from the partner's system.
    - `metadata`: Additional information or metadata related to the job.

#### Example `POST` Request:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.development.app.meetharper.com/integrations/direct/job" \
    -H "Authorization: ******" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "id": "job123",
        "status": "pending",
        "partnerJobID": "partner456",
        "metadata": "Initial job creation"
    }'
```

#### Example Response:
Upon successful creation, the API will return the created job object:
```json
{
    "id": "job123",
    "status": "pending",
    "partnerJobID": "partner456",
    "metadata": "Initial job creation",
    "createdAt": "2024-09-18T13:04:31Z",
    "updatedAt": "2024-09-18T13:04:31Z"
}
```

### 2. **Updating the Status of an Existing Job**

- **Endpoint**: `PUT /integrations/direct/job/:jobID/status`
- **Headers**: Include the API key in the request header:
  ```
  Authorization: ******
  ```
- **URL Parameter**:
  - `:jobID`: The unique ID of the job to update.
- **Body**: Send a JSON payload with the updated status.
  - **Required Fields**:
    - `status`: The new status of the job (e.g., `"in-progress"`, `"completed"`).

#### Example `PUT` Request:
```bash
curl -X PUT "https://api.development.app.meetharper.com/integrations/direct/job/job123/status" \
    -H "Authorization: ******" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "status": "in-progress"
    }'
```

#### Example Response:
Upon a successful update, the API will return the updated job object:
```json
{
    "id": "job123",
    "status": "in-progress",
    "partnerJobID": "partner456",
    "metadata": "Initial job creation",
    "createdAt": "2024-09-18T13:04:31Z",
    "updatedAt": "2024-09-18T14:12:22Z"
}
```

### 3. **Retrieving the Status of an Existing Job**

- **Endpoint**: `GET /integrations/direct/job/:jobID/status`
- **Headers**: Include the API key in the request header:
  ```
  Authorization: ******
  ```
- **URL Parameter**:
  - `:jobID`: The unique ID of the job whose status you want to retrieve.

#### Example `GET` Request:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.development.app.meetharper.com/integrations/direct/job/job123/status" \
    -H "Authorization: ******"
```

#### Example Response:
The API will return the current status of the job along with other job details:
```json
{
    "id": "job123",
    "status": "in-progress",
    "partnerJobID": "partner456",
    "metadata": "Initial job creation",
    "createdAt": "2024-09-18T13:04:31Z",
    "updatedAt": "2024-09-18T14:12:22Z"
}
```

### 4. **Error Handling**

- **Missing or Invalid API Key**: If the API key is missing or invalid, the API will return an `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` error.
- **Invalid Request Data**: If the request payload is missing required fields or contains invalid data, the API will return an `HTTP 400 Bad Request` error with a descriptive message.
- **Job Not Found**: If you attempt to update or retrieve a job that does not exist, the API will return an `HTTP 404 Not Found` error.

### 5. **Important Notes**

- **Authorization**: All requests to these endpoints require an API key. Include this key in the `Authorization` header of each request:
  ```
  Authorization: ******
  ```
- **IDempotency**: The `PUT` request for updating the job status is idempotent, meaning you can safely call it multiple times with the same data without changing the result.
- **Status Update**: Make sure to use only the allowed status values (`"pending"`, `"in-progress"`, `"completed"`). The API will return an error for any unsupported status.

By following this workflow, you can create, update, and check the status of jobs efficiently while ensuring data integrity and security through API key-based authorization. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please contact our support team.
